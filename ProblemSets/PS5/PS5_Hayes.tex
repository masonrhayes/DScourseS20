\section{Web Scraping without API}

\begin{itemize}
    \item I found patent data from \href{https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-top-50-2018.htm}{IFI Claims}
    \item I used this data because I am interested in examining the changes in patent data from individuals and corporations and how these changes may be correlated with economic growth or inequality
    \item I think this will be useful as an illustration of how US markets are becoming more concentrated
    \item I didn't use any tutorials but I did use our in-class example as a starting point
\end{itemize}

\section{Web Scraping with API}

\begin{itemize}
    \item I found years of stock data for my portfolio of choice
    \item I used the riingo package in R, which calls the \href{https://api.tiingo.com/documentation/general/overview}{Tiingo API}
    \item To manipulate all this data, I also used the following packages
        \begin{itemize}
            \item tidyquant
            \item PortfolioAnalytics
            \item PerformanceAnalytics
            \item ggthemes
            \item quantmod
            \item and more (in the R script)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
