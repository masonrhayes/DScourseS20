\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The length of the training set is 404.
    \item For LASSO: the optimal value of lambda is 0.0059. The aggregated RMSE over the 6 iterations is 0.1660. The RMSE in the test data is 0.1675.
    \item I was unable to tune the hyperparameters with mlr3.
    \item I couldn't figure out how to do elastic net or ridge (other than simply copying all of the example code)
\end{enumerate}
