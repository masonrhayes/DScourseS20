\section{Possible Web Scraping}

\begin{itemize}
    \item I would like to look at financial data such as cryptocurrency markets or the stock market. Lately I have been messing around with gekko trading bot as well as learning how to get stock data through the tiingo API. I think I could use one of these sources for the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{PS4 Answers}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item df1 is a data frame
        \item df is a SparkDataFrame
    \end{itemize}
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item At first I was using tidyverse to create df1, which I later realized overrided the native RDD functions of sparkR. Neither the select or filter function worked on df until I reloaded sparkR without the tidyverse library.
        \item Once doing it correctly (without tidyverse), the select and filter functions do not work on df1 because it is a data frame, not a spark data frame, and those functions only work on RDDs.
        \item With tidyverse, of course, the select and filter functions work on df1 because sparkR is calling the tidyverse functions, not the RDD functions.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
